Cross-contamination pipeline

**requirements**
* LAST (http://last.cbrc.jp/) - LAST binary path should be added to $PATH linux variable
* join C++ libraries
* condor like clusters (can be adapted to SGE, OAR or PBS schedulers)
   * only in linux nodes
* Only decontaminate DNA libraries
* A table of species with taxon codes
   * If your libraries are based on MMETSP format (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001889), it will be automatically generated by buildSpeciesTable.sh script (tag TAXON_ID= is needed inside each sequence header)
   * if you are not able to provide a table of you libraries are not in the format of MMETSP, you should provide a complete lineage of each sequence and execute taxonTreeBuilder.sh script
* Libraries and organisms should have unique names, even if the were located at different directories

**HOWTO**

please, look at
```
example/toy.sh
```
